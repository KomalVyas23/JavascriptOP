A JavaScript Symbol is a primitive datatype just like Number, String, or Boolean.

It represents a unique "hidden" identifier that no other code can accidentally access. This is the sole reason, why symbols are used.

Let's say, an object dog belongs to some other codebase, then its unsafe to add fields inside that object, because we might affect pre-defined behaviour in codebase.

Symbols are accessible using bracket notation only. Because they are used to create hidden properties of an object.

Symbols are ignored in for in loop.
